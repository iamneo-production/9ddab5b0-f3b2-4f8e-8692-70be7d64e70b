                 <p>In a lot of circles, alcohol is a big part of the social scene. From college parties to weddings and simple get-togethers with friends, there’s often alcohol involved.

But what if you don't drink?

Maybe you’re in recovery, or you’re just taking a break to see how it feels. Either way, you’re planning to get through the night alcohol-free.

Turning down alcohol can feel awkward, particularly if you’re hanging out with people who’ve seen you drink in the past.

Whether you’ve decided to go sober from now on or you’re just having a night off the booze, these tips can help you navigate the situation.

             <div className="life-text-two">
                 <p>This is a little similar to the advice above, but it might work better for you.

If you’re comfortable holding alcohol and not actually drinking it, you could “nurse” a beverage, gradually “drinking” it by pouring it out in the bathroom or offering it to friends to try.

Maybe you’re cool with drinking a little alcohol, but you don’t want to get drunk. You could order a drink at the start of the evening and sip it over the course of a few hours, letting your friends assume it’s actually multiple drinks instead.

                 <p>Be honest
Excuses might work in the short term. But, if you’re planning on not drinking for a while, or you’re with trusted friends, you might consider being honest.

Everyone has a different relationship with alcohol, and it’s fine to be frank about your decision to avoid it. Unlike excuses, which may only work until the next time you go out with your friends, being honest can get your friends off your back long-term.

Who knows, you might even find out that someone else is navigating a similar situation.

                 <p>If you don’t feel like explaining yourself to someone, you’re allowed to give them a “no” and leave it at that. Particularly if it’s a stranger, you’re entitled to keep your business private.

However, you might find that people aren’t bothered. The thought of not drinking in a social situation can sometimes be more difficult than the reality. Often, people just don’t care.

Plus, if you’re at a party or somewhere with a finite amount of alcohol, you’re doing them a favor by leaving more for everybody else.

After all, you’re not trying to police their drinking habits, you’re just saying no for yourself.

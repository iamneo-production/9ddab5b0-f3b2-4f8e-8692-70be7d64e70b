                 <p>A healthy diet can improve and maintain health, which can include aspects of mental and physical health.Specific diets, such as the DASH diet, can be used in treatment and management of chronic conditions.Exclusionary diets are diets with certain groups or specific types of food avoided, either due to health considerations or by choice

Dietary recommendations exist for many different countries, and they usually emphasise a balanced diet which is culturally appropriate. These recommendation are different from dietary reference values which provide information about the prevention of nutrient deficiencies.

                 <p>A particular diet may be chosen to promote weight loss or weight gain. Changing a person's dietary intake, or "going on a diet", can change the energy balance, and increase or decrease the amount of fat stored by the body. The terms "healthy diet" and "diet for weight management" (dieting) are often related, as the two promote healthy weight management. If a person is overweight or obese, changing to a diet and lifestyle that allows them to burn more calories than they consume may improve their overall health, possibly preventing diseases that are attributed in part to weight, including heart disease and diabetes.

                 <p>Within the past 10 years, obesity rates have increased by almost 10%. Conversely, if a person is underweight due to illness or malnutrition, they may change their diet to promote weight gain. Intentional changes in weight, though often beneficial, can be potentially harmful to the body if they occur too rapidly. Unintentional rapid weight change can be caused by the body's reaction to some medications, or may be a sign of major medical problems including thyroid issues and cancer among other diseases.

                 <p>Grain and cereal foods include rolled oats, brown rice, wholemeal and wholegrain breads, cracked wheat, barley, buckwheat, and breakfast cereals. Wholegrain foods are better for you because they have more fibre and vitamins.
                 These foods contain protein, minerals, and vitamins. Legumes, nuts, and seeds also have dietary fibre. Itâ€™s good to choose a variety of foods from this group. Oily fish such as salmon and mackerel are very healthy. It is recommended that you eat these twice per week.

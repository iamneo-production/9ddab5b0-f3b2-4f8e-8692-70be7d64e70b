‚ÄúIn 2018, I was serving as a corpsman for the United States Coast Guard and on track to enter nursing school upon completion of my service in the military.
 While riding my motorcycle and on my way to pick up my last nursing book, I was hit by a distracted driver. I suffered severe trauma including brain bleeds, broken bones, and countless other painful injuries.
 Doctors told me that if I hadn't been eating healthy foods or staying active, I would have died...   
That was a HUGE wake up call for me. I started thinking about all the young people who didn't know about good nutrition or physical fitness, or those who just didn't have access to a healthy lifestyle. I didn't realize what a difference healthy living makes until my life was literally on the line. Not everyone has the resources or tools they need to live a healthy lifestyle, and I want to change that.‚Äù Jacob McDonnell  </p>

BlueLight serves youth, and vulnerable families in the Central Florida area to achieve good health and wellness through training, education, and by creating an environment of togetherness.
